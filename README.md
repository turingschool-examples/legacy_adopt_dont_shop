<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[Adopt Don't Shop](https://fathomless-inlet-21274.herokuapp.com/) is a module 2 solo project for Turing School of Software & Design's Back-End Engineering (BEE) program. Users are able to apply to adopt pets and admins can either approve or reject applications. In addition admins also see adoption statistics for shelters, pets, and applications in the system. User stories were tracked using Github projects [here](https://github.com/elyhess/adopt_dont_shop/projects/2).
