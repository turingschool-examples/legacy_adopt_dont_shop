Approved/Rejected Pets on one Application do not affect other Applications

As a visitor
When there are two applications in the system for the same pet
When I visit the admin application show page for one of the applications
And I approve or reject the pet for that application
When I visit the other application's admin show page
Then I do not see that the pet has been accepted or rejected for that application
And instead I see buttons to approve or reject the pet for this specific application
