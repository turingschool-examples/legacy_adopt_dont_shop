Rejecting a Pet for Adoption

As a visitor
When I visit an admin application show page ('/admin/applications/:id')
For every pet that the application is for, I see a button to reject the application for that specific pet
When I click that button
Then I'm taken back to the admin application show page
And next to the pet that I rejected, I do not see a button to approve or reject this pet
And instead I see an indicator next to the pet that they have been rejected
